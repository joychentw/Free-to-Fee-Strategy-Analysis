# Free-to-Fee-Strategy Analysis
Feb, 2021

## Introduction
The “freemium” business model — widely used by online services such as LinkedIn, Match.com, Dropbox, and music-listening sites — divides user populations into groups that use the service for free and groups that pay a fee for additional features. Key points related to the freemium model:   
  	•	Free accounts are monetized using online advertising  
	  •	Premium subscribers (those paying a fee) are typically 24 times more profitable than free users  
	  •	However, premium subscribers are rare  
    
More useful background information in the following paper:

High Note is an anonymized real music streaming company --- similar to Last.fm, Spotify or Pandora --- that uses a freemium business model.   
Here I am working on High Note customer data, including:    
	•	Demographic characteristics such as age, gender and country    
	•	Social network characteristics such as number of friends a user has on the network    
	•	Engagement level data on activities performed when using the service, which include the number of songs the user has listened to, playlists created, “shouts” sent to friends, etc.    
   
   
 ## Objective 
Given the higher profitability of premium subscribers, it is generally in the interest of company to motivate users to go from “free to fee”; that is, convert free accounts to premium subscribers. In regards to this case, I will analyze the data for potential insight to inform a “free-to-fee” strategy.     
Literature shows that peer influence and user engagement can affect users’ decisions to pay for a premium subscription. Using the High Note data, I will predict the decision to buy using both types of variables. Results will quantify the effect of social engagement on revenue, as well as how valuable a premium subscriber can be in a freemium social community.

  1.	Summary statistics: Generate descriptive statistics for the key variables in the data set, similar to the table on the last page of the case. Analyze the differences in the mean values of the variables. Compare the adopter and non-adapter subsamples.           
  2.	Propensity Score Matching (PSM): Use PSM to test whether having subscriber friends affects the likelihood of becoming an adopter (i.e., fee customer). For this purpose, the "treatment" group will be users that have one or more subscriber friends (subscriber_friend_cnt >= 1), while the "control" group will include users with zero subscriber friends. Use PSM to first create matched treatment and control samples, then test whether there is a significant average treatment effect. Provide an interpretation of the results.    
  3.	Regression Analyses: Use a logistic regression approach to test which variables (including subscriber friends) are significant for explaining the likelihood of becoming an adopter. Estimate the odds ratios for the key variables.   
  4.	Takeaways
